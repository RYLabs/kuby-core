Kuby used to ship with a default environment called "development" that was capable of running your application locally using the copy of Kubernetes that comes with [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

Unfortunately it proved to be too difficult to maintain, so support was removed in version 0.12.0.

If you'd like to see support for dev environments, please file an issue.
