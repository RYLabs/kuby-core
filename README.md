## Kuby

Deploy your Rails app the easy way.

## What is Kuby?

At its core, Kuby is a set of tools and smart defaults that encapsulate and codify years of established best-practices around deploying webapps, reducing the amount of time required to take your Rails project from an app that runs on your computer to an app that runs on the Internet.

Under the hood, Kuby leverages the power of Docker and Kubernetes. It tries to make these technologies accessible to the average Rails dev without requiring a devops black belt.

## Getting Started

See the [Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/getkuby/kuby-core/wiki/Quick-Start-Guide)

## More Info

See the [wiki](https://github.com/getkuby/kuby-core/wiki).

## Running Tests

`bundle exec rspec` should do the trick... or at least it would if there were any tests. Don't worry, it's on my radar.
